Apache Thrift Server for Stanford CoreNLP
=========================================

This is a client/server setup of Stanford's [CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml) which uses [Apache Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/).

**It has since been replaced with the [Ã˜MQ-based Stanford CoreNLP client/server](https://github.com/dmnapolitano/stanford-0mq).**
