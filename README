You need to follow all of these steps in order!

1. Add all the jar files in /home/nlp-text/dynamic/NLPTools/thrift/lib to your CLASSPATH.
2. Run 'ant'. This will compile the thrift definition and create both the Java and Python wrappers.
3. Copy over "stanford-parser-wrapper.jar" to your preferred location AND add that location to your CLASSPATH.
4. Copy over the 'stanfordparser' directory under the 'gen-py' directory to your preferred location AND add that location to your PYTHONPATH (do NOT include 'stanfordparser' as part of the path).
5. Start the server on any machine using scripts/start_server.sh
6. To use the Java client, look at scripts/parse-java.sh
7. To use the Python client, look at scripts/parse-python.sh

The packaging for Python is not currently ideal since the server needs to be in Java. For Java, there's a nice jar file that contains both the server and the client. Note also that the server is currently simply taking an input sentence and generating a string containing its parse. In the future, we might want the parser to actually return a more complex data structure.
